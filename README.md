# Deque Toolkit
Here is the repo for the Script Sages' third and final project; the Deque Toolkit!

# Design Decisions
**deque.h**
- The 'allocateBlock()' and 'expandBlockmap()' were placed into the private section of the class since they are functions that the user should not be interacting with directly.

# How To Run The program
All testing is automated. All you have to do is type in 'make' to compile, './deque' to start the program, and then finally type in the name of one of the test files. For this project, this will be 'test.txt', 'test2.txt', or 'test3.txt.'

# Challenges
The biggest challenge would have to be time constraints; with the end of the year rapidly approaching, and various other projects requiring our attention, we were not able to converse with eachother as much as we would have wished to.

# How we Shared our work
We mostly communicated over text and kept our changes to mostly one branch; mainly since we were lacking on time and getting ready for finals.
